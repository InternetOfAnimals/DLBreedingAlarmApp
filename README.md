# DLBreedingAlarmApp
Desert locust plagues are still a threat to vegetation and agricultural lands in Africa and Asia as the recent outbreak in East Africa demonstrates. This is because it is a complex task to predict when and where desert locust will start breeding as this depends on several environmental conditions.

Previous work covered the creation of machine learning models as well as building a micro service which uses this models to  identify in real-time risk areas for locust breeding.

This work is about developing  a complementing  App which can be installed on a field rangers smart phone and shows the alarm notifications of the service on a map and allows the user to provide feedback on whether it was a correct or false alarm.
